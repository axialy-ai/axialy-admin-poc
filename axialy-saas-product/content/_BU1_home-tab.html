        </p>
        <h2>How to Use AxiaBA</h2>
        <p>
            After logging in, you will land here, on the Home tab. The main workspaces you will use
            are: <strong>Generate</strong>, <strong>Refine</strong>, <strong>Reports</strong>, and
            <strong>Settings</strong>. Below is an overview of each tab’s purpose, along with
            guidance on how to use them step-by-step.
        </p>

        <!-- 1) Generate Tab -->
        <section class="tab-overview">
            <h3>1. Generate Tab</h3>
            <p>
                In the <strong>Generate</strong> tab, you will create or build out your initial
                business analysis data. This is your launching point for capturing new ideas,
                concepts, or scenarios that AxiaBA can help you structure and expand.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Input Text:</strong> In the first ribbon, enter the textual description
                    of the business scenario or analysis context you want to explore. AxiaBA
                    automatically counts your characters and can generate an <em>Input Text
                    Summary</em> (e.g., Title, Summary, UTC Timestamp).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Choose AI Focus Areas:</strong> In the second ribbon, select the
                    focus area templates you’d like AxiaBA to apply to your input text. These
                    templates help tailor AI-generated outputs to different analysis viewpoints,
                    such as requirements, user stories, or risk assessments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhance with AI (Third Ribbon):</strong> Press
                    <em>Send Selected</em> to fetch generative AI results based on your input text
                    and the chosen focus areas. When results arrive, AxiaBA displays them in new
                    “dynamic ribbon” grids at the bottom. Each grid corresponds to one focus area
                    and can be modified or expanded by you (for example, adding rows, deleting
                    rows, or editing cells).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Save Data:</strong> After reviewing and adjusting the AI-generated data
                    in these dynamic ribbons, press <em>Save Data</em> to store them within an
                    analysis package in AxiaBA’s database. Before finalizing, you can review and
                    update the package header (title, summary, and description).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once saved, this new analysis package is available for further refinement and
                stakeholder collaboration in the <strong>Refine</strong> tab. Note that you can
                create multiple packages by repeating this process with new or existing input
                texts and different focus areas.
            </p>

        <!-- 2) Refine Tab -->
        <section class="tab-overview">
            <h3>2. Refine Tab</h3>
            <p>
                In the <strong>Refine</strong> tab, you review and enhance existing analysis
                packages. AxiaBA displays a set of package “tiles,” each with high-level metrics
                (ID, name, summary, stakeholder feedback indicators, etc.). Selecting a tile
                opens the corresponding package’s focus areas and records.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Open Package:</strong> Click the package tile to load its details. If
                    you need to filter or locate specific packages, use the search box. You can
                    also enable “Show Deleted” if you want to see previously removed or archived
                    packages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>New Focus Area:</strong> From the <em>Package Actions</em> menu, you
                    can create a new focus area with its own set of records. This expands the 
                    package’s scope and can lead to new focus-area versions once changes are saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Refresh Package Content:</strong> Reloads the package data in real
                    time. Handy if you suspect new stakeholder feedback has arrived, or if you
                    made changes in another tab or session.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Show Deleted Content:</strong> Toggles the visibility of any
                    “soft-deleted” focus areas or records. Useful for restoring or auditing older
                    data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Edit Package Header:</strong> Revisits the package’s name, summary,
                    or long description. Similar to the overlay you see when saving a new
                    package in Generate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remove Package:</strong> Marks the entire package as deleted.
                    You can restore it later by enabling “Show Deleted” and selecting “Recover
                    Package.”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each focus area within the open package has a <em>Refine Data</em> or
                <em>Refine Activities</em> menu providing options like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhance Content (AI):</strong> Leverage generative AI to improve
                    existing data or reorganize it based on new instructions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Request Feedback:</strong> Send a “Content Review Request” link to 
                    specified stakeholders who can provide feedback (Approve/Revise, etc.)
                    without needing their own AxiaBA account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Compile Stakeholder Feedback (AI):</strong> Summarize and apply 
                    stakeholder input automatically, producing a refined version of the focus area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>New Record:</strong> Add individual property-value records to
                    the focus area. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remove Focus Area:</strong> Soft-delete the entire focus area’s data,
                    which can be recovered later if needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Recover Versions:</strong> Restore a previous version of the focus
                    area if you wish to revert changes or compare historical data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can also <strong>Export CSV</strong> for any focus area, downloading 
                current records for offline review. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the Refine tab offers versioned edits, stakeholder collaboration,
                and flexible data manipulation, making it the heart of AxiaBA for ongoing 
                analysis and maintenance.

        <!-- 3) Reports Tab -->
        <section class="tab-overview">
            <h3>3. Reports Tab</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Reports</strong> tab provides operational insights into your analysis
                process. Initially, the focus is on stakeholder feedback metrics. You can see which
                requests are outstanding, which have been addressed, and how many items were
                revised or approved. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stakeholder Feedback Requests Report:</strong> Track all your 
                    feedback invitations, listing the stakeholder email, associated package, 
                    focus area, and response status. Filter the report by stakeholder, package,
                    or date range as needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pagination &amp; Filtering:</strong> Long lists are broken into 
                    pages, with user-configurable “records per page.” Filters enable focusing on
                    a subset of requests (e.g., show only “unresponded” items).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As AxiaBA evolves, more report types and advanced analytics will be added,
                giving you deeper visibility into your analysis artifacts, collaboration 
                patterns, and overall usage trends.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- 4) Settings Tab -->
        <section class="tab-overview">
            <h3>4. Settings Tab</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Settings</strong> tab lets you manage <em>custom organizations</em>
                and set your <em>Focus Organization</em>. This is particularly helpful if
                you're handling multiple clients, departments, or business units.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create Custom Organization:</strong> Provide a name, logo, and
                    optional contact details. Any newly generated or refined analysis packages can
                    be assigned to this organization to keep data separate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Focus Organization:</strong> Use the dropdown to decide which
                    organization's data you want to see in Refine. Packages tagged to other 
                    organizations remain hidden unless you switch focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Organization Cards:</strong> Each custom organization displays in
                    Settings with relevant details. You can edit or replace the logo, update 
                    contact info, or remove the organization if it’s no longer needed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Organizing data by client or department is easy with AxiaBA’s built-in
                organizational controls. Switch your focus organization at any time to
                view different sets of packages in the Refine tab.
